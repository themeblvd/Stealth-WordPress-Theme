msgid "<p>With custom post types and custom menus in WordPress 3.0, WordPress has totally changed the potential for theme making. Some concepts of how this theme manages portfolios may seem unusual at first, but once you get used to how things work, you'll see how much more efficient everything is.</p><h4 style=\"margin: 10px 0pt;\">The overall concept of creating your first portfolio.</h4><p>1. Create a new <em>Portfolio</em>. You can think of a <em>Portfolio</em> as a \"category\" if that helps you visualize it a bit better.</p><p>2. Create several <em>Portfolio Items</em> that each consist of:</p><ul><li>Title</li><li>Content</li><li>Excerpt</li><li>Media Link (Full URL to enlarged image, YouTube video, Vimeo video, .mov file, or .swf file)</li><li>Thumbnail (featured image)</li><li>Portfolio (i.e. Which portfolio is this portfolio item assigned to?)</li></ul><p>3. Add your <em>Portfolio</em> (i.e. \"category\" of portfolio items) to a menu under Appearance &gt; Menus.</p><p>4. Now that your <em>Portfolio</em> has been added to a menu, it's live on your website. When someone visit that <em>Portfolio</em>, they'll see all of that <em>Portfolios's</em> items displayed in a gallery view.</p><p><em>Note: Under Appearance &gt; Menus, if you do not see your Portfolios in the left column, it just means you have them hidden. Just click the Screen Options tab in the top right corner and then check off \"Portfolios.\"</em></p><h4 style=\"margin: 10px 0pt;\">Let's clear up one common misconception :-) </h4><p><em>\"I'm trying to add a portfolio page, but when I create a new page, there's no Portfolio page template? Why?\"</em></p><p>There's no need for that any more. Before WordPress 3.0, the only logical way to create a main menu was to list out WordPress pages. So, then the dilemma was that if you didn't want a \"blog\" for your homepage, how would you have a link to a \"blog\" from your main menu? So, theme authors started creating page templates that would list out the blog posts, and thus that \"page\" could be added to the main menu. Then, when theme authors started offering portfolios with their themes, the same thing needed to be done, as a portfolio would simply be another method of listing out \"posts.\"</p><p>With WordPress's menu builder you can add a blog's category, or in this case a \"Portfolio\", directly to your main menu. There's no need for creating a page in order to accomplish this.</p> "

You can specify the excerpt when creating your posts, and if you do not specify one, WordPress will automatically take the first 55 words of your post and use that. In an excerpt, you cannot have any HTML code; it is plain text only. Any HTML tags (links, images, etc.) that you attempt to put in the excerpt will be stripped by WordPress.</p>\n"

"\t\t\t\t<p>When using this option, if you'd like to pick a spot for the post to be cut off and insert a link to the post, this is commonly referred in WordPress as the \"teaser\". When you're writing a post, you can insert <em>&lt;!--more--&gt;</em> anywhere in the post, and it will cut off at that point and a link will be shown that leads to the post.
